  A wristwatch with 3 buttons written in VHDL and implemented on an ARTIX-7 FPGA board.

# Functions
  - Digital watch
  - Alarm clock
  - Timer
  - Stopwatch
# How?
  The watch is a state machine and with each button press it jumps into the next corresponding state. For each state there are corresponding processes that accomplish a task.
  The state machine diagram:
